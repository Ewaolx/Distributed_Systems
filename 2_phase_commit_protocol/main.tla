RM == 1..RN
\* The set of participating resource managers

(***************************************************************************
The following is a specification of transaction commit that is written
in what is perhaps a more natural PlusCal style than that in module
PTCommit because processes "terminate" rather than "deadlocking".  It
is identical to the algorithm in that module except for two changes:

1. The predicate of the `while' loop has been changed so an RM exists
the loop when it terminates.

2. The RManager process is made a `fair' process, meaning that weak
fairness of is assumed.  Weak fairness means that each RM that is
continuously able to take a step must eventually do so.
